The file data_processing.py contains the code that opens the Federal Election Comission data from the 115the Congress (2017-2018) and selects the relevant information. 

The file also upens the already scraped legislative bill information from Pro Publica and creates relevant variables for the machine learning model. Additionally, it plots a histogram with the bills that did pass to check for consistency during the timeframe. Finally, it merges the Federal Election Comission and Pro Publica dataframes by text similarity from the names of the sponsors of bills.
