# Legislation Collection Process

## Process

1. **Fetch Bills Data:**
   - The `fetch_all_bills_for_session` function retrieves bill data for a given session, chamber, and bill type using the ProPublica Congress API.
   - The fetched data is saved in chunks to JSON files, allowing for incremental data retrieval and backup in case of interruptions.

2. **Retrieve Raw Text of Bills:**
   - The `add_raw_text` function utilizes Selenium with a Chrome WebDriver to extract the raw text of bills from the Congress website.
   - The function iterates through the bills data, retrieves the bill text, and adds it to the respective entry in the dataset.
   - In case of errors during the process, exceptions are handled by saving the data and error details to separate files for later inspection.

3. **Analyze Bill Counts:**
   - The code analyzes the counts of different types of bills (e.g., 'hr', 'hres', 'hconres', 'hjres') for each Congress session (115th to 118th).
   - It also calculates the ratio of bills where the 'house_passage' field is not null, providing insights into the progress of bills in the House.

Overall Rationale:

This code is designed to systematically fetch bill data from the ProPublica Congress API and complement it with the raw text of bills obtained through web scraping. The use of Selenium ensures the retrieval of detailed bill text from the Congress website. The incremental data saving mechanism helps in recovering from interruptions, and the analysis of bill counts provides a quick overview of the dataset. Additionally, the demonstration of sample bill text showcases the functionality of the web scraping process.
