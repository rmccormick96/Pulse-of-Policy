Rosen is seeking election to the Senate in November. Tarkanian’s Democrat opponent is Susie Lee.According to Open Secrets’s latest data, Lee’s campaign has doubled Tarkanian’s in terms of dollars raised and spent; $3.9 million raised and $3.1 million spent to $1.8 million raised and $1.4 million spent.Open Secrets further lists “outside spending” supporting and opposing both Tarkanian and his Democrat opponent as almost equal, with $7.9 million supporting Rosen and $7.8 million supporting Tarkanian.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee – a pro-Democrat PAC — has spent $4.5 million on the aforementioned race. Its Republican counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, has spent $3.9 million.Tarkanian said, “I believe very strongly in America First policies that President Trump had articulated. We need to secure our borders, build a wall where it’s necessary, make sure we know who’s coming in and out of our country, and what products are coming in and out of our country.”LISTEN:Tarkanian praised President Donald Trump’s economic and trade policies.“I believe very strongly in what President Trump has done on the economic front,” said Tarkanian. “[He is] eliminating the burdensome and unreasonable regulations, making the tax system fair, fairer not only for the businesses but for also for individuals.\\xa0He added, “I also believe in a lot of the thing he’s doing on the tariff side. We don’t want to see more tariffs imposed in a war, but we are paying much more in tariffs than the other countries that we trade with, and it’s unfair. Tarkanian continued, “We put American businesses and American workers at a huge disadvantage. I’m hoping that President Trump’s strong negotiation skills will help eliminate the tariffs and put us on a level playing field.”Tarkanian critiqued “nation-building” foreign policy as incompatible with prioritizing America’s national interest.“I don’t believe we should be going overseas and fighting wars unless there’s an imminent threat to our national security, or that of our close allies,” stated Tarkanian.“We shouldn’t be going overseas and nation-building. We spent three trillion dollars in the Middle East, right now, where that money could have been used to take care of our veterans, first and foremost, who’ve been over there fighting, but also take care of the people that need help here in the United States instead of wasting it overseas,” assessed Tarkanian.Tarkanian highlighted his ongoing support for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump before and after NBC and the Washington Post coordinated to release the “Access Hollywood tape” weeks before 2016’s presidential election.Tarkanian said, “I was a MAGA candidate first, when nobody else was in Nevada. I was the only federal candidate that supported candidate Trump until the end of the last election, all of our other top elected officials — our governors, senators, senate candidates, congressmen — they all came out and demanded Trump step out as a nominee when that [Hollywood Access] tape came out. Tarkanian went on, “I’m the only person who supported candidate Trump at the time, because I believe very strongly in those MAGA principles and we see how they’re working, now.”He finished by noting his opponent’s unwillingness to participate in future debates.Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.Follow Robert Kraychik on\\xa0Twitter.Midterm ElectionPoliticsRadioAmerica FirstDanny TarkanianDonald TrumpJacky RosenMAGA'"

       "\"Theresa May’s time as Prime Minister may be coming to an end, with MPs telling her to “bring her own noose” to a crunch meeting on Wednesday as former Brexit Secretary David Davis sets out his leadership stall.Theresa May was already under pressure over her many concessions to the European Union and attempts to agree a so-called ‘backstop’ with the bloc, which would keep the United Kingdom inside the EU Customs Union in order to avoid customs checks between the British province of Northern Ireland and the EU’s Republic of Ireland — effectively stopping the country from making new global trade deals after Brexit.Her latest proposal to extend a proposed ‘transition period’ with the EU, during which Britain will remain subject to Brussels but lose all of its representation in EU institutions, appears to have been the final straw, costing her support among both the Brexiteer and Remainer\\xa0wings of the Tory Party.Members of the party’s powerful 1922 Committee — comprised of all the party’s parliamentary backbenchers\\xa0— are now suggesting they will trigger a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister if she fails to persuade them at a crunch meeting on Wednesday.“She should bring her own noose to the ’22. Short of an uncharacteristically powerful, persuasive, and coherent performance, then I think her time will be up,” said one senior Brexiteer quoted by the Mail on Sunday.‘It’s Just Chaos’ – Pro-Brexit and Pro-EU Tories All Turning on Theresa May over Negotiations  https://t.co/UyPuhslHwB— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 19, 2018Meanwhile, former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who resigned from Theresa May’s Cabinet after she unveiled her Chequers plan for the EU negotiations — which he believes would not restore Britain’s sovereignty in a meaningful way — has published a column widely interpreted as a preliminary leadership bid, as it sets out how the direction he would take the negotiations with Brussels if it was up to him.“The EU is not entitled to split up the UK,” Davis wrote on the subject of the backstop — which Brussels wants to apply to Northern Ireland alone, effectively carving off the country from the wider British economy and annexing it to the EU for customs purposes.“And the EU is not entitled to direct how we regulate our economy and govern ourselves after we leave,” he continued. “We should not allow ourselves to be bullied by the EU. Now is the time to stand up for the national interest and plot a better course.”The “better course” Davis argues for would be no-holds-barred, with Britain dramatically stepping up preparations for a ‘No Deal’ Brexit and meeting the EU threat for threat on claims that, for example, flights between Britain and the EU could be grounded if a treaty favouring Brussels is not signed.“This is extremely improbable as it would undermine the Spanish and other European tourism markets as well as Mediterranean property markets,” he observed — before adding that a ‘No Fly Zone’ over Britain would also have a dramatic impact on flights from the EU.“European flights would still need our airspace in order to fly to the USA,” he warned.Leo Varadkar implying Britain won't be able to fly over Irish airspace after Brexit is probably the dumbest comment made this year. Take a look at just how many flight paths from Dublin cross over the UK! ⬇️\\u200d♂️🙋\\u200d♀️ Support us at https://t.co/iICfFb8qqg pic.twitter.com/8vk3k1zvJQ— Leave.EU (@LeaveEUOfficial) July 20, 2018Allies of Mr Davis have suggested Boris Johnson, another leading Brexiteer tipped as a possible successor to Mrs May, would become Davis’s deputy, and that Davis would step aside for him once Brexit was delivered.Allies of the former Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary do not seem particularly enthused about allowing Davis to step in as an interim ‘caretaker’, however, and co-operation between the two Brexiteers has been limited since their Chequers resignations.London / EuropePoliticsBritainBrusselsDavid DavisEUEuropeEuropean UnionTheresa MayToriesTory partyUnited Kingdom\""
